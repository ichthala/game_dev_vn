"???" "Hey there. I understand you're the new apprentice?"

i "That's me."

"???" "Fantastic. I'm Angela. I'm a game designer for Astral War."

d "I just wanted to check in and see if you had any questions for me."

i "I do have a question, actually."

d "What is it?"

i "Well, er, what exactly... do you..."

i "...do?"

"Angela laughs."

d "That's actually a very good question. Game designers do a lot of things. One of my favorite things about this job is that I don't have a typical working day."

"She glances down at her smart watch."

d "It looks like I have a few minutes before my 3 o'clock meeting. Why don't we sit at the lunch table and I'll try to give you a real answer?"

i "I'd love that!"
